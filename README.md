```
What the fuck is this?```
I honestly don't know, there was no planning nor any thought to this, I just coded whatever popped into my head.

```
Why TypeScript and not C#?```
Like I said I don't know, I am more comfortable in JavaScript / TypeScript when it comes to doing things that I am unsure of, and they're mainly my go to langs when doing new things.

```
Are you going to do it in C#```
Frankly? I have no clue. I might not even finish this honestly, as I have no idea or direction of what I'm doing or going.
I might redo it if I finish it and it gets semi-popular I guess.

```
This game sucks!```
Sorry to hear that. From what it sounds like I actually finished the game enough to get into a (semi) playable state, so yay me.
